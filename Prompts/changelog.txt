PROMPT CHANGELOG

=== v1_baseline.txt ===
Date: 2025-10-28
Description: Original prompt from project inception
Notes:
- Includes explicit scratchpad instruction
- Causes Claude to output planning process in final summary
- Otherwise good structure and guidance

=== v2_no_scratchpad.txt ===
Date: 2025-10-28
Description: Remove scratchpad instruction
Changes from v1:
- Removed entire "Process" section with scratchpad instruction
- Claude 4.x models think internally without being asked
- Should produce cleaner output without planning artifacts
Rationale:
- Per Claude 4 best practices, models think internally by default
- Explicit scratchpad instruction causes unwanted output
- Simpler prompt, cleaner results
